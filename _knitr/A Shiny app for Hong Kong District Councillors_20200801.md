# A Shiny app for Hong Kong District Councillors

## TL;DR

There is a significant barrier in accessing updates from local politicians in Hong Kong. In this project, we tackled this problem by creating a Shiny app in R, which brings together the Facebook feeds and constituency information for Hong Kong's district councillors in one place. 

You can access the app [here](https://hkdistricts-info.shinyapps.io/dashboard-hkdistrictcouncillors/), and view our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/avisionh/dashboard-hkdistrictcouncillors).

Whether you are more of an R enthusiast or simply someone who has an interest in Hong Kong politics (hopefully both!), we hope this post will bring you some inspiration on how you can use R _not just_ as a great tool for data analysis, but also as an enabler for you to do something tangible for your community and causes you care about.
