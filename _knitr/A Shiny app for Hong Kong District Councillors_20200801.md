# üëÄ TL;DR

We built an [R Shiny app](https://hkdistricts-info.shinyapps.io/dashboard-hkdistrictcouncillors/) to improve access to information on Hong Kong's local politicians. This is so that voters can make more informed choices. The app shows basic information on each politician, alongside a live feed of their Facebook page and illustrative maps of their district.

## üíª Overview
Our project was mainly motivated by an observation, i.e. **that the engagement of the Hong Kong public with their local politicians is very low.**[^1] Historically, the work of Hong Kong's District Councillors (DCs) are neither widely known nor closely scrutinised by the public media. Until recently, most District Councillors did not use webpages or Facebook pages to share their work, but instead favour distributing physical copies of 'work reports' via Direct Mail. A hypothesis is that this has changed significantly with the 2019 District Council election, where turnout has jumped to 71% (from 47% in 2015). For context, Hong Kong's District Councils is the most local level of government, and is the only level in which there is full universal suffrage for all candidates.

[^1]: There are many reasons for this, and arguably a similar phenomenon can be observed in most local elections in other countries. See Lee, F. L., & Chan, J. M. (2008). Making sense of participation: The political culture of pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. *The China Quarterly*, 84-101.

As of the summer of 2020, we identified that 96% (434) of the 452 District Councillors elected in 2019 actually have a dedicated Facebook page for delivering updates to and engaging with local residents. However, these Facebook pages have to be manually searched for online, and there is not a readily available tool where people can quickly map a District to a District Councillor and to their Facebook feeds. 

As a wise person once said, "If you can solve a problem effectively in R, why the hell not?" We tackled this problem by creating a Shiny app in R, which brings together the Facebook feeds and constituency information for Hong Kong's district councillors in one place. In this way, people will be able to access the currently disparately stored information in a single web app.

You can access:

- The Shiny app [here](https://hkdistricts-info.shinyapps.io/dashboard-hkdistrictcouncillors/). 
- Our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/avisionh/dashboard-hkdistrictcouncillors/). 
- Don't forget to also provide some feedback to the Shiny app [here](https://hkdistrictsinfo.typeform.com/to/gFHC02gE)!

Whether you are more of an R enthusiast or simply someone who has an interest in Hong Kong politics (hopefully both!), we hope this post will bring you some inspiration on how you can use R _not just_ as a great tool for data analysis, but also as an enabler for you to do something tangible for your community and contribute to causes you care about. 

## üîç What is in the app?

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinctc/blog/master/images/hkdc-app-example.png)

The Shiny app is built like a dashboard which combines information about each district councillor alongside their Facebook page posts (if it exists) and the district they serve, illustrated on an interactive map.

Specifically, there are several key components that were used on top of the incredible [shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) package:

- [shinydashboard](https://github.com/rstudio/shinydashboard): For mobile-friendly dashboard layout.
    + We understood that our users, primarily HK citizens, frequently use mobiles. Thus, to ensure this app was useful to them, we centred our design on how the app looked on their mobile browsers.
    
- [googlesheets4](https://github.com/tidyverse/googlesheets4): For seamless access to GoogleSheets.
    + We understood that our users are not all technical so we stored the core data in a format and platform familiar and accessible to most people, Google Sheets.
    
- [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) and [leaflet](https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet): For importing geographic data and creating interactive maps.
    + We understood that our users may want to explore other parts of Hong Kong but may not know the names of each constituency. Thus, we provided a map functionality to improve the ease they can learn more about different parts of Hong Kong.

- [rintrojs](https://github.com/carlganz/rintrojs): For interactive tutorials.
    + We understood that our users are not necessarily keen to read pages of instructions on how to use the app, especially if they are on mobile. Thus, we implemented a dynamic feature that walks them through visually each component of the app.

## How was the data collected?

<Insert screenshot>

- Data on each district councillor, their constituency, the party they belong to and their Facebook page was all collected manually through a combination of Wikipedia and Facebook.
    + We kept the data outside of the repo to keep the memory size small.
    + Stored it in GoogleSheets so non-technical users can access the data too.
- Data on each district councillors contact details were web-scraped from ...
- Boundaries for each constituency were obtained through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request by a member of the public [here](https://accessinfo.hk/en/request/shapefileshp_for_2019_district_c).

### Creating a data package
From sharing our project with friends, we were approached to help with another project to visualise Hong Kong traffic collisions data, repo is [here](https://github.com/Hong-Kong-Districts-Info/hktrafficcollisions). As part of this, we obtained this data via an FOI request on traffic collisions. In the interests of open-source, we developed an R package, [hkdatasets](https://github.com/Hong-Kong-Districts-Info/hkdatasets) that stores these datasets, all themed around Hong Kong.

### Linking to Facebook

- Found a workaround using just iframes - expedient but fit-for-purpose

### Visualising the shapefiles

- To rapidly get a Proof of Concept up using the shapefiles, we created a static ggplot map.
- This was to quickly visualise the districts and how they look in relation to the Shiny app.
- Once we settled on how the map looked in relation to the Shiny app, we then spent some additional time and effort to investigate using [leaftet](https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet)
- We moved to `leaflet` maps because of their interactivity. 
     + We understood our users would want to explore the HK map interactively to find out what consituency they belong to or to find out one that was of interest. This was because we were aware that people may know what region they live in but they may not know the name of the consituency.

## What are our next steps?
- Some cool stuff we have not been able to implement:

    + [precommit hooks](https://github.com/Hong-Kong-Districts-Info/dashboard-hkdistrictcouncillors/issues/17): Those familiar with Python may be aware of pre-commit hooks as ways to automatically detect whether your repo contains anything sensitive like a `.secrets` file. Setting this up will enable us to have automated checks run each time we make a commit to assure we are follow specified standards.
    + [codecov](https://github.com/Hong-Kong-Districts-Info/dashboard-hkdistrictcouncillors/issues/33): Allows us to robustly test the functions in our code so that they work under a multitude of scenarios such as when users encounter problems.
    + [modularise shiny code](https://github.com/Hong-Kong-Districts-Info/dashboard-hkdistrictcouncillors/issues/26): Ensures our Shiny code is more easier to follow.
    + [language selection](https://github.com/Hong-Kong-Districts-Info/dashboard-hkdistrictcouncillors/issues/36): Currently the app is a smorgasbord of English and Chinese. Consequently, it looks messy. We want to implement the ability for the user to choose which language they want to see the app in and the app's language will update accordingly.
    + Release to alpha testers to get early feedback.
    
## Who is behind this?

Multiple people contributed to this work. **Avision Ho** is a data scientist who wrote the majority of the Shiny app, and who was also [previously interviewed on this blog](https://martinctc.github.io/blog/data-chats-an-interview-with-avision-ho/). Avision is a co-author on this post. **Ocean Cheung** came up with the original idea of this app, and made it all possible with his knowledge and network with District Councillors. We would also like to credit **Justin Yim**, **Tiffany Chau**, and **Gabriel Tam** for their 
feedback and advice on the scope and the direction of this app. We are currently working on a number of other projects, which you can find out more from our website: https://hong-kong-districts-info.github.io/.
