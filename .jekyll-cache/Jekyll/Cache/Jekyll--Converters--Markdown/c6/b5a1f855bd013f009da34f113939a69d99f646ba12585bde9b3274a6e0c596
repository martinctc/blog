<h2>RMarkdown is awesome!</h2>
<p>When I first started using <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">RMarkdown</a>, it felt very much like a blessing.</p>
<p>Not only does the format encourage reproducible analysis by enabling you to interweave code, text, images, and plots, it also allows you to <code>knit()</code> the document into so many different formats, including static HTML, MS Word, PowerPoint, PDF - <strong>everything done from the comfort of the RStudio IDE!</strong></p>
<p>I also love the fact that whilst the outputs are highly customisable (e.g.Â adding your own CSS), it is also incredibly easy to produce a professional document by using an existing template (e.g.Â see <a href="https://github.com/yixuan/prettydoc">prettydoc</a> and <a href="https://github.com/juba/rmdformats">rmdformats</a>). In fact, this blog post itself is written using RMarkdown. If you havenâ€™t tried RMarkdown yet, Iâ€™d highly recommend it - and <em>R Markdown: The Definitive Guide</em> <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/">is a good place to start</a>.</p>
<p>But this post isnâ€™t about selling RMarkdown. Actually, itâ€™s about a relatively trivial inconvenience* Iâ€™ve recently experienced when using RMarkdown in work, and how Iâ€™ve found a simple solution to overcome this issue.</p>
<p>*hence first world problem</p>

<h2>RMarkdown documents that are too long!</h2>
<p><img src="https://martinctc.github.io/blog/images/fwp-rmarkdown.png" width="80%" style="padding:10px" /></p>
<p>I quite often use RMarkdown to document my data exploratory analysis - e.g.Â when Iâ€™m coming across a completely new set of data.</p>
<p>The problem is simple: as I explore different cuts of the data and layer more plots, tables, and text onto my RMarkdown document, it gets unmanageably long (1,000 lines+). Although I can create more functions and <code>source()</code> them externally from a separate R file where possible, there is a limit to how much I can shorten the length of the Rmd file. As the file gets longer, errors become more common and debugging becomes more difficult.</p>
<p>However, it is not completely straightforward to split a RMarkdown document into multiple files and use <code>source()</code> to combine them into a single document, because <code>source()</code> doesnâ€™t work on RMarkdown documents. A RMarkdown document contains more than just R code, and what youâ€™d ideally want is to be able to combine both the code chunks and the accompanying text commentary. So I did some digging on Stack Overflow and found a solution that I was pretty happy with.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<div id="the-solution" class="section level2">
<h2>The solution</h2>
<p>The first step I did was to get my RMarkdown â€˜contentsâ€™ into multiple files that fit into the following structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The â€œMotherâ€ Rmd</strong> - this is the file that will take in all the content from the â€œchildâ€ Rmd. I would keep this file relatively short and usually just use this for loading packages and functions. This is the <em>only</em> Rmd file that should have a YAML header (the starting bits specifying title, author, and knit output options). There should only be <strong>one</strong> â€œMotherâ€ Rmd.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>â€œChildâ€ Rmd(s)</strong> - these files would hold most of the analysis and be read into the â€œMotherâ€ Rmd. You can have more than one of these â€œChildâ€ Rmd files, and apart from the fact that these files wonâ€™t have a YAML header, they should be no different from a typical Rmd file. Theyâ€™ll still have the same .Rmd file extension, and you can do section headers (e.g.Â h1, h2, h3â€¦) and code chunks as normal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My habit is then to have my working directory in the following structure, where my RMarkdown files are all saved in a <strong>Rmd</strong> sub-folder under a <strong>Scripts</strong> folder, separate from my functions. The example below shows a <strong>mother</strong> Rmd file called <em>main_analysis_file.Rmd</em>, and four child Rmd files named <em>analysis-part1.Rmd</em>, <em>analysis-part2.Rmd</em>, and so on:</p>
<ul>
<li>root project directory
<ul>
<li><strong>Data</strong> - <em>where I save my raw data</em></li>
<li><strong>Output</strong> - <em>where I save my analysis and plot outputs</em></li>
<li><strong>Scripts</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rmds</strong> - <em>save all Rmd scripts here</em>
<ul>
<li>main_analysis_file.Rmd [mother]</li>
<li>analysis-part1.Rmd [child]</li>
<li>analysis-part2.Rmd [child]</li>
<li>analysis-part3.Rmd [child]</li>
<li>analysis-part4.Rmd [child]</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Functions</strong> - <em>save functions here</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Once Iâ€™ve organised all my analysis in the individual child Rmd files, all I need to do is to â€œsourceâ€ these Rmd files into the â€œmotherâ€ file. Instead of using <code>source()</code>, Iâ€™ll use code chunks in the â€œmotherâ€ Rmd file. To make the file path referencing a bit more easier to deal with, I use <code>here::here()</code> to help R find the right Rmd files:<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martinctc/blog/master/images/child_code_chunks.png" width="100%" style="float:left; padding:10px" /></p>
<p>Note that you donâ€™t need to include anything in those R code chunks within the â€œmotherâ€ Rmd. If everything has worked, <code>knit</code>-ting from the â€œmotherâ€ Rmd file should get you an output that draws from all the children Rmd.</p>
<p>Then thatâ€™s pretty much it! The outcome is that you still get outputs that contain the entire analysis, but code and documentation that is better organised and much easier to follow.</p>
